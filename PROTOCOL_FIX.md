# âœ… Protocol Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
Claude Desktop was using protocol version "2024-11-05" but the server was responding with "1.0.0", causing a version mismatch and disconnection.

## Solution Applied
- âœ… Server now matches the client's protocol version
- âœ… Added proper working directory handling  
- âœ… Improved message processing timing
- âœ… Better error handling and logging

## Current Status
The server now:
- âœ… Uses protocol version "2024-11-05" (matches Claude Desktop)
- âœ… Responds correctly to initialize messages
- âœ… Changes to correct working directory automatically
- âœ… Has improved connection stability

## Test Results
```
Received: protocol "2024-11-05"
Responded: protocol "2024-11-05" âœ“
```

## Next Step
**Restart Claude Desktop** and test the connection. The server should now maintain a stable connection with Claude Desktop.

Your config is still correct:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "project-zomboid": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\winkk\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python313\\python.exe",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\winkk\\code\\pzmcp\\run_server_v2.py"],
      "cwd": "C:\\Users\\winkk\\code\\pzmcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The protocol version issue has been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
